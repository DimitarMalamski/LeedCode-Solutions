# LeedCode Solutions
This repository contains my daily LeetCode problem-solving practice. It is part of my preparation for software engineering internships during my studies at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

---
## Goals
- Strengthen knowledge of Data Structures & Algorithms;
- Build consistency by solving problems daily;
- Prepare for technical interviews;
- Track and showcase progress publicly;
